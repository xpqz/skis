# Code Rules and Processes for this project

**KEY RULES**:

- NEVER CLAIM THAT SOMETHING IS COMPLETE IF THERE ARE REGRESSIONS. RUN THE FULL TEST SUITE BEFORE AND AFTER EACH WORK UNIT.
- NEVER USE `--no-verify` WITH GIT!
- **ABSOLUTELY NO CONDITIONAL IMPORTS ANYWHERE** - ALL imports must be at file top, including in tests

## Test Locations

- **CRITICAL**: Unit tests MUST be placed in `tests/`
- Test files should be named `test_*.py`
- Scenario tests go in `tests/scenarios/`

## Developing in Python

- Never do "fallback" programming in terms of requirements: if you expect module A, fail immediately if it's not present
- **CRITICAL**: No conditional imports. All imports at the top of files only
  - WRONG: `from bar.baz import foo` inside a function
  - CORRECT: All imports at file top, even if only used in one test method
  - This applies to ALL files: source code, tests, scripts, everything
- Use up-to-date Python syntax, version 3.10 and onwards
- Backwards compatibility is NOT a goal, neither in terms of Python, nor in terms of this project's code itself
- Use modern type hinting (dict, not Dict)

## Debugging

- **CRITICAL**: Always identify root causes of failures. Do NOT treat the symptoms of failures.

## Process

- Don't back files up by copying! We use git for versioning.
- For each new development stage, create a new git branch first.
- We practice TDD:
  - Write tests first that demonstrate the desired behaviour
  - Pause for human review of the tests
  - Progress the implementation until the tests succeed.
  - NEVER tweak a test to "fit" the behaviour, unless the test is demonstrably broken.
  - Once a test set has been reviewed and approved, that's a contract: do NOT skip or change without re-approval. All approved tests MUST pass before PR.
  - Before opening a PR, you MUST ensure that the full test suite is green.
  - Review any skipped, xfailed and xpassed tests.
  - Fix any pytest warnings.
- Maintain progress in docs/TODO-X.md files
- Don't use /tmp and other locations outside the current repository: use the tmp/ directory in the repository dir instead, provided for this purpose
- If you create temporary scripts for debugging, remove them after use, and ensure not committed to git

## GitHub Workflow

- **NEVER EVER CHANGE THE DEFAULT BRANCH ON GIT OR GITHUB!**
- When creating PRs or commits, **DO NOT** mention Claude, Anthropic, or AI assistance in the message

**Note**: Don't bulk-add changes to git! Add modifications, additions and deletions individually, based on the knowledge of what you have actually done. That makes it easier for the human to follow, too. Doing it this way reduces the chance that unintended changes makes it into git.

Follow this process for each GitHub issue:

1. **Pick an issue** - Note its ID number
2. **Create branch** - Name format: `{ID}-{slug-derived-from-issue-title}`
   - Example: `9-parser-grammar-basic-terms`
3. **Write tests FIRST** - STOP after writing tests for human review
4. **Commit approved tests** - Only after review approval
5. **Implement until tests pass** - Make the tests green
6. **Run complete test suite** - No regressions tolerated!
7. **Create PR** - Make an orderly PR, squashing commits if necessary.
8. **Verify CI** - Ensure all CI tests pass fully
9. **Await PR review** - Wait for human review
10. **Merge** - After approval, merge PR and verify that tests complete in CI
11. **Maintain issues** Maintain issues by checking boxes where relevant after every commit. If all boxes are ticked, close the issues.
12. **Maintain epics** Update the Epic issue where relevant by ticking any boxes as issues are closed. If all sub-issues are closed, also close the epic.

In any git and GitHub messaging (commit messages, PR messages, issues, comments etc), we maintain a terse, professional tone:

1. **Never make unproven claims**: don't make claims about the validity, effectiveness or awesomeness of your changes in a commit or other message. By definition, that is determined by the CI results, which you can't see yet. Explain what was done, and why. Be modest and factual.
2. **Never use emoji symbols**: we're not 14-year-olds on Instagram here. No green ticks, no red crosses, no smileys, no symbols.
3. **Don't use bold text**: don't embellish or add emphasis with bold or italic text.
4. **Brevity**: issues and commit messages are written for co-workers. Respect their time. Obviously, be complete, but express yourself in a professional, concise tone.
5. **UK English**: we use UK English spelling throughout.
